# User can view the details of a product - Back End.

## Implementation

For this feature you will be defining an Express.js endpoint to handle `GET` requests to `/api/products/:productId` that sends _all_ data about a specific product in the `"products"` table.

### ðŸ’° Motivation

The client will be displaying the details of a specific product to the user, so the endpoint should return all information about that particular product.

### âœ… Task List

- Add an endpoint to handle `GET` requests to `/api/products/:productId` just after your endpoint for `GET /api/products`.
- Within the callback, query the database for all columns of the product that matches the specified `productId`.
- If the product can't be found, call `next()` with a new `ClientError`, passing it an error message and appropriate status code.
- If querying the database fails, pass the error to `next()`.

### Tips

Be sure to return a **JSON Object** for this feature and not a **JSON Array**.

Test your endpoint with the following command. Try different `productId`s.

```
http -v get localhost:3000/api/products/1
```

Be sure to handle the following failure scenarios and test for them:
  - The `Promise` returned from querying the database is rejected (call `next()` with the error). You should be able to force a `500` by messing up your SQL query.
  - The requested product does not exist (call `next()` with a `new ClientError()`)
